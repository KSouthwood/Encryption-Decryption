# Encryption-Decryption
Encryption-Decryption project in Java. From JetBrains Academy (hyperskill.org).

### About
Privacy is an important matter is the realm of the Internet. When sending a message, you want to be sure no-one but
the addressee with the key can read it. The entirety of the modern Web is encrypted - take https for example! Donâ€™t stay
behind: hop on the encryption/decryption train and learn the essential basics while implementing this simple project.

##### Stage 1: Encrypted!
Simply output the encrypted string of "we found a treasure!" The cipher is replacing each letter with the letter in the
corresponding position from the end of the alphabet. (i.e. a->z, b->y...y->b, z->a)

##### Stage 2: Knowledge is key
Get input of a string, and a key (an integer). Use the key to encode the string using the Caesar cipher which rotates all
letters forward _x_ amount of letters, wrapping around from z to a.

##### Stage 3: Decrypted!
Read three lines of input: a target operation, a message or ciphertext, and a key to use to encrypt or decrypt the 
message. All non-letter characters are to be shifted as well as letters.
